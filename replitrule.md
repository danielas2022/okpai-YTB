**Prompt:**

I have a 3-minute 24-second English video, and I have already extracted its English subtitles. I need to make some adjustments to the subtitle content based on my requirements, with the following conditions:

1. **Subtitle adjustments**: Adjust the wording and sentences in the subtitles according to my modifications. Please note that while the content of the subtitles may change, the overall tone and meaning must remain consistent.

2. **Timeline unchanged**: The length of the video cannot change, and the timestamps for each subtitle (when each line appears) must remain the same to ensure smooth synchronization with the video.

3. **Voice replacement**: Use TTS (Text-to-Speech) technology to generate audio that corresponds to the modified subtitles. The audio must match the rhythm and timeline of the video, keeping the original visuals and length intact.

4. **Video merging**: After generating the new audio, merge the modified subtitles and TTS-generated audio with the original video, ensuring the visuals, timeline, audio, and subtitles are perfectly synchronized.

The final output should have the same duration as the original video (3 minutes 24 seconds), with unchanged visuals. The modified subtitles and audio should reflect the adjustments I provided, and the timing should remain in sync with the video.
